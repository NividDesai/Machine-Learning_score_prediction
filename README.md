Comprehensive machine learning pipeline analyzing 1,044+ students across UCI datasets. Implements complete workflow: EDA, feature engineering, 10 regression models (linear, tree-based, ensemble), two prediction scenarios (with/without intermediate grades achieving 82.7% and 23.1% R² respectively), hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis identifying absences and failures as key factors.
